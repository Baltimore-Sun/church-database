        <strong>KNOWN TIES TO MARYLAND: </strong>Rented an Ellicott City condo to Father Robert Trupia, who was credibly accused of child sexual abuse.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>ACCUSATION DESCRIPTION: </strong>As part of a global settlement, the Marianist order settled a 2003 lawsuit with an abuse claim against Fatooh from 1973-1974, when he was principal of Chaminade College Prep in California. Fatooh has said the claim was "meritless." In another case, the Diocese of Monterey, California, settled a 2009 lawsuit for $1.2 million regarding an abuse complaint. Fatooh said in a pretrial deposition that while he led the diocese, he did not report the complaint involving another priest to authorities. Fatooh resigned in 2003 over renting a condo to Trupia, who he also used as a consultant from 1995 to 2001. His attorney, John Duffy, denied Fatooh engaged in wrongdoing and said Fatooh has never been charged with a crime. Duffy said Fatooh "didn't have any connection with Trupia other than he just knew him and he was contacted about renting the condo."

        <strong>KNOWN TIES TO MARYLAND: </strong>Cardinal of Archdiocese of Washington, which includes part of Maryland.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>ACCUSATION DESCRIPTION: </strong>Starting no later than 1994, McCarrick was accused of sexually harassing and inappropriately touching adult seminary students, resulting in at least two settlements. He was removed from ministry in 2018 after being credibly accused of molesting a 16-year-old in the 1960s; he said in a 2018 statement that he had no recollection of the teen's abuse. McCarrick has twice been found incompetent to stand trial in Wisconsin and Massachusetts in 2023. His Wisconsin lawyer, Jerome Buting, said he “is unavailable to comment due to having progressed dementia. He is in a care facility in Missouri, and unable to comprehend or communicate with others.”

          <strong>KNOWN TIES TO MARYLAND: </strong>Rented an Ellicott City condo to Father Robert Trupia, who was credibly accused of child sexual abuse.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>ACCUSATION DESCRIPTION: </strong>As part of a global settlement, the Marianist order settled a 2003 lawsuit with an abuse claim against Fatooh from 1973-1974, when he was principal of Chaminade College Prep in California. Fatooh has said the claim was "meritless." In another case, the Diocese of Monterey, California, settled a 2009 lawsuit for $1.2 million regarding an abuse complaint. Fatooh said in a pretrial deposition that while he led the diocese, he did not report the complaint involving another priest to authorities. Fatooh resigned in 2003 over renting a condo to Trupia, who he also used as a consultant from 1995 to 2001. His attorney, John Duffy, denied Fatooh engaged in wrongdoing and said Fatooh has never been charged with a crime. Duffy said Fatooh "didn't have any connection with Trupia other than he just knew him and he was contacted about renting the condo."

          <br />
          <strong>ACCUSATION DESCRIPTION: </strong>Starting no later than 1994, McCarrick was accused of sexually harassing and inappropriately touching adult seminary students, resulting in at least two settlements. He was removed from ministry in 2018 after being credibly accused of molesting a 16-year-old in the 1960s; he said in a 2018 statement that he had no recollection of the teen's abuse. McCarrick has twice been found incompetent to stand trial in Wisconsin and Massachusetts in 2023. His Wisconsin lawyer, Jerome Buting, said he “is unavailable to comment due to having progressed dementia. He is in a care facility in Missouri, and unable to comprehend or communicate with others.”
